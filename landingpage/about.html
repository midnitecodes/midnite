        <p>
          In 2023 we started as a small detailing shop — a crew of friends who loved cars and the
          late-night conversations that come with them. As we grew, we tried the usual paths: a
          traditional service business, then an ecommerce shop. But it never felt authentic.

        <p>
          What changed was a question: what if we built something that solved the real problems
          gearheads face — not just another storefront? So we shifted focus. We built tools for
          sharing builds, finding trusted parts, organizing meets, and supporting local crews.
          Midnite Auto is the result: a platform designed by enthusiasts, for enthusiasts.

          We're more than products and listings. A portion of our proceeds supports youth
          mechanics programs and community events. Our mission is simple but bold —
          <strong class="racing-highlight">ignite connection, create impact, and keep the car culture alive 24/7.</strong>
          Join the people who refuse to be a copy of someone else — build with us.

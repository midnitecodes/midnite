    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
      In 2023 we started as a small detailing shop — a crew of friends who loved cars and the
      late-night conversations that come with them. As we grew, we tried the usual paths: a
      traditional service business, then an ecommerce shop. But it never felt authentic.
    </p>

    <p>
      What changed was a question: what if we built something that solved the real problems
      gearheads face — not just another storefront? So we shifted focus. We built tools for
      sharing builds, finding trusted parts, organizing meets, and supporting local crews.
      Midnite Auto is the result: a platform designed by enthusiasts, for enthusiasts.
    </p>

    <p>
      We’re more than products and listings. A portion of our proceeds supports youth
      mechanics programs and community events. Our mission is simple but bold —
      <strong>ignite connection, create impact, and keep the car culture alive 24/7.</strong>
      Join the people who refuse to be a copy of someone else — build with us.
